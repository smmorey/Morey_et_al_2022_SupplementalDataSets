# Supplemental Data Set 1 
*Supplemental Data Set 1 from [Morey et al. (2022)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021JF006498).*
<p> This data set includes hydraulic variables (depth, speed, bed shear stress, flood power) at every previously identified megaflood deposit from Table S1. </p>
<p> The folder <em>SandLimits</em> contains the same variables, but with a highlighted region that shows the bed shear stress limits relevant for transport of sand (0.063-2.0 mm).</p>
