# Supplemental Data Sets

*This folder contains Supplemental Data Sets from Morey et al. (2022). 
Each Data Set includes hydraulic variables (depth, speed, bed shear stress, flood power) from 2D simulations of a megaflood in the eastern Himalaya:*
- **Data Set S1** : every previously identified megaflood deposit from Table 1, including bed shear stress limits relevant for transport of sand (0.063-2.0 mm).
- **Data Set S2a** : every kilometer downstream of the dam (0 km) to the end of the Yarlung Tsangpo Gorge (165 km)
- **Data Set S2b** : every kilometer from the end of the Yarlung Tsangpo Gorge (165) to Pasighat (507 km).
